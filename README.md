## Project Description

The project includes two Javascript CodeGrade challenges

- Student Grade Generator
  This program takes the student marks as input and returns the correct grade based on the score.
- Speed Detector
  This program takes the speed of a car and provides feedback based on the speed, including the number of demerit points and a warning if the speed is exceeded or a suspension of the driver's license once the demerit points reaches a certain limit.

## Technologies Used

1.  JavaScript
2.  Node.js (Used to run the code)

## Challenges

### Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40.

### Speed Detector

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

## Installation And Setup

To setup this project locally(on your device)

1. Clone the repository using the following steps
    ```\bashrc.
     git clone git@github.com:your-repo-name/code-challenges.git (SSH)
     ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory using
   ```bash
      cd/your-repository-name
   ```
3. Open the JavaScript files (studentgradegenerator.js) and (speeddetector.js) in your text editor.

## Usage (How someone will be able to run the code)
1. Open the terminal.
    - For the student grade generator, open it and enter the marks, then you will see the corresponding grade.
      ```javaScript
         node studentgradegenerator.js
      ```
    - For the speed detector, run the script in order to get the corresponding feedback
      ```javaScript
      node speeddetector.js
      ```
